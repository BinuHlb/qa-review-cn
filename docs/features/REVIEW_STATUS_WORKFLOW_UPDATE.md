# Review Status Workflow Update

## Overview
Updated the review status workflow to prevent reviews from showing as "Completed" before the final review process. Now reviews go through a proper workflow: **In Progress → Submitted → Completed**.

## Problem Solved
Previously, reviews would show as "Completed" immediately after the reviewer finished their work, which was confusing because the review wasn't actually complete until the final review process was done.

## New Status Workflow

### **Status Progression**
```
Pending → In Progress → Submitted → Completed
    ↓         ↓           ↓          ↓
  Assigned  Working   Ready for   Finalized
           on Review  Final Review
```

### **Status Definitions**

| Status | Description | Color | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----------|
| **Pending** | Review assigned but not started | Yellow | Initial assignment |
| **In Progress** | Reviewer is actively working | Blue | During review process |
| **Submitted** | Review completed by reviewer, ready for final review | Purple | After reviewer submits |
| **Completed** | Final review approved and finalized | Green | After admin/CEO approval |
| **Overdue** | Past due date | Red | When deadline passed |
| **Cancelled** | Review cancelled | Gray | When cancelled |
| **Rejected** | Final review rejected, sent back for revision | Red | When rejected |

## Changes Made

### 1. **Interface Updates**
- **`lib/mock-data.ts`**: Added `'Submitted'` and `'Rejected'` to status union type
- **`lib/schemas/review.schema.ts`**: Updated Zod schema validation

### 2. **Mock Data Updates**
- **`lib/mock-data.ts`**: Changed all `'Completed'` statuses to `'Submitted'` in mock data
- Reviews now show as "Submitted" (purple) instead of "Completed" (green)

### 3. **Color Coding**
- **`lib/mock-data.ts`**: Added purple color for "Submitted" status
- **`lib/utils/review-utils.ts`**: Updated utility function with proper color mapping

### 4. **Dashboard Logic Updates**
- **`app/admin/dashboard/page.tsx`**: `readyForFinal` now filters by `'Submitted'` status
- **`app/ceo/dashboard/page.tsx`**: `readyForCEO` now filters by `'Submitted'` status
- **`app/admin/final-reviews/page.tsx`**: Shows reviews with `'Submitted'` status
- **`app/ceo/final-reviews/page.tsx`**: Shows reviews with `'Submitted'` status

### 5. **API Route Updates**
- **`app/api/reviews/[id]/submit/route.ts`**: Sets status to `'Submitted'` when reviewer submits
- **`app/api/reviews/[id]/final-review/route.ts`**: Sets status to `'Completed'` when final review is approved

## Workflow Process

### **Step 1: Review Assignment**
- Status: `Pending` (Yellow)
- Admin assigns review to reviewer

### **Step 2: Review in Progress**
- Status: `In Progress` (Blue)
- Reviewer actively working on the review

### **Step 3: Review Submission**
- Status: `Submitted` (Purple)
- Reviewer completes and submits their work
- Review appears in "Final Reviews" section
- Ready for admin/CEO final review

### **Step 4: Final Review Process**
- Admin/CEO reviews the submitted work
- Can approve (→ `Completed`) or reject (→ `Rejected`)

### **Step 5: Finalization**
- **Approved**: Status becomes `Completed` (Green)
- **Rejected**: Status becomes `Rejected` (Red), sent back for revision
