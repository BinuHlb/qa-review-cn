# Dynamic Attachments Implementation

## Overview
Successfully converted the hardcoded attachments section in the split screen to a fully dynamic, reusable system with proper state management and API integration capabilities.

## Issues Fixed
- **Hardcoded Attachments**: Previously had static attachment data in `ReviewActionPanel`
- **No Reusability**: Attachment functionality was tightly coupled to one component
- **Limited Functionality**: No proper upload, remove, or download handling
- **No State Management**: Attachments were managed with basic useState

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Reusable Attachments Component
**File**: `components/shared/attachments-section.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Fully Configurable**: Props for upload, remove, download handlers
- **Drag & Drop Support**: Visual drag and drop zone with hover states
- **File Type Icons**: Different icons for PDF, images, videos, etc.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Empty State**: Clean empty state when no attachments
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations

### 2. Created Attachments Management Hook
**File**: `hooks/use-attachments.ts`

**Features**:
- **State Management**: Centralized attachment state management
- **Async Operations**: Support for async upload, remove, download
- **Error Handling**: Built-in error handling with console logging
- **Loading States**: Tracks uploading and removing states
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, remove, clear attachments
- **Flexible API**: Works with or without custom handlers

### 3. Updated ReviewActionPanel
**File**: `components/reviews/review-action-panel.tsx`

**Changes**:
- **Removed Hardcoded Data**: Eliminated static attachment array
- **Added Props**: New props for attachment management
- **Integrated Hook**: Uses `useAttachments` for state management
- **Replaced UI**: Uses new `AttachmentsSection` component
- **Maintained Functionality**: All existing features preserved

### 4. Enhanced Admin Reviews Page
**File**: `app/admin/reviews/page.tsx`

**Features**:
- **Per-Review Attachments**: Each review has its own attachment state
- **API Simulation**: Simulates real API calls with delays
- **State Persistence**: Attachments persist when switching between reviews
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for all operations
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support

## Technical Implementation

### Attachment Interface
```tsx
interface Attachment {
  id: string
  name: string
  size: string
  uploadedBy: string
  uploadedAt: string
  type: string
  url?: string
}
```

### Hook Usage
```tsx
const {
  attachments,
  isUploading,
  isRemoving,
  handleUpload,
  handleRemove,
  handleDownload
} = useAttachments({
  initialAttachments,
  onUpload: onAttachmentUpload,
  onRemove: onAttachmentRemove,
  onDownload: onAttachmentDownload
})
```

### Component Usage
```tsx
<AttachmentsSection
  attachments={attachments}
  onUpload={handleUpload}
  onRemove={handleRemove}
  onDownload={handleDownload}
  maxHeight="250px"
  showUpload={true}
  showDownload={true}
  showRemove={true}
/>
```

## Features Implemented

### ✅ **Dynamic Upload**
- **File Selection**: Click to browse files
- **Drag & Drop**: Visual drag and drop interface
- **Multiple Files**: Support for multiple file uploads
- **File Validation**: Type and size validation
- **Progress Feedback**: Visual feedback during upload

### ✅ **File Management**
- **Remove Files**: Delete attachments with confirmation
- **Download Files**: Download attachments with proper handling
- **File Information**: Display name, size, uploader, date
- **File Type Icons**: Visual indicators for different file types

### ✅ **State Management**
- **Per-Review State**: Each review maintains its own attachments
- **Persistence**: Attachments persist when switching reviews
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate UI updates on changes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and recovery

### ✅ **User Experience**
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during operations
- **Empty States**: Clean empty state with helpful messaging
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard and screen reader support

## API Integration Ready

### Upload Handler
```tsx
const handleAttachmentUpload = async (reviewId: string, files: File[]): Promise<Attachment[]> => {
  // Real API call would go here
  const formData = new FormData()
  files.forEach(file => formData.append('files', file))
  
  const response = await fetch(`/api/reviews/${reviewId}/attachments`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData
  })
  
  return response.json()
}
```

### Remove Handler
```tsx
const handleAttachmentRemove = async (reviewId: string, attachmentId: string): Promise<void> => {
  await fetch(`/api/reviews/${reviewId}/attachments/${attachmentId}`, {
    method: 'DELETE'
  })
}
```

### Download Handler
```tsx
const handleAttachmentDownload = async (attachment: Attachment): Promise<void> => {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/attachments/${attachment.id}/download`)
  const blob = await response.blob()
  
  const url = window.URL.createObjectURL(blob)
  const link = document.createElement('a')
  link.href = url
  link.download = attachment.name
  link.click()
  window.URL.revokeObjectURL(url)
}
```
